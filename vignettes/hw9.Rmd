This example appears in [40]. Consider the bivariate density
$$
f(x,y)\propto \left ( \begin{matrix}
n \\
x
\end{matrix}
\right )y^{x+a-1}(1-y)^{n-x+b-1},x=0,1,...,n,0\le y\le 1. 
$$
It can be shown (see e.g. [23]) that for fixed a,b,n, the conditional distributions are Binomial(n,y) and Beta(x+a,n−x+b). Use the Gibbs sampler to generate a chain with target joint density f(x,y).


```{r}
library(Rcpp)
library(StatComp)
# 参数设置
n = 100
a = 10

# 运行R和Rcpp版本

x_r = gibbsR(n, a)
x_cpp = gibbsC(n, a)

qqplot(x_r[,1], x_cpp[,1], main = "QQ Plot for X", 
       xlab = "R Gibbs Samples", ylab = "Rcpp Gibbs Samples")
abline(0, 1, col = "red")

qqplot(x_r[,2], x_cpp[,2], main = "QQ Plot for Y", 
       xlab = "R Gibbs Samples", ylab = "Rcpp Gibbs Samples")
abline(0, 1, col = "red")

library(microbenchmark)

benchmark_results = microbenchmark(
  R_version = gibbsR(n, a),
  Rcpp_version = gibbsC(n, a),
  times = 10
)

print(benchmark_results)

```
From the results, there is not much difference between the r version of the code and the rcpp version of the code, but the rcpp version of the code is significantly less time-consuming and more efficient.
